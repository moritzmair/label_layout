# label_layout
This is a single html file that lets you layout labels for a print on to bought label stickers.

If you are too lazy to download this just open it up directly: https://cdn.rawgit.com/moritzmair/label_layout/20c3b374/labels.html

To use it just open labels.html in a browser. Select how many rows and colums you need and with margins your label layout stickers have.
You can either just fill all the fields by hand or import a csv file. Rows will be ignored and cells will just be filled up.

If you have more ideas let me know: http://moritzmair.de
