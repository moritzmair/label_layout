# label_layout
This is a single html file that lets you layout labels for a print onto bought label stickers.

To use it just open labels.html in a browser. Select how many rows and colums you need and with margins your label layout stickers have.
You can either just fill all the fields by hand or import a csv file. Rows will be ignored and cells will just be filled up.
